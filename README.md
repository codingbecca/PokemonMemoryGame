Built using React and the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), this app is a simple memory game where the goal is to click on 9 different pokemon in a row, without repeating a selection. When the game is won or lost, you have the option to play again with 9 randomly generated pokemon. 

# Technologies Used
